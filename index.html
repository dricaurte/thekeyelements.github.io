					<h1>ROCKING SINCE 1989</h1>
						<p>The Key Elements is a co-ed a cappella group at Cornell University. Founded in 1989, the group mainly performs pieces in<br/>
							genres such as classic rock, alternative, punk, and other contemporary popular music.&nbsp; </p>
						<p>The Key Elements also regularly travels to other east coast universities and completed its first international tour in Ireland in January 2009.</p>
						<p>Known as Cornell's Most Dangerous Sound Machine, as well as Cornell's first and only vocal rock group, the Key Elements is like no other group on campus.&nbsp; Unconventional?&nbsp; Check.&nbsp; Innovative?  Check.&nbsp; Always pushing the envelope?&nbsp; That's a given.</p>
