        <p>The Key Elements is a co-ed a cappella group at Cornell University. Founded in 1989, the group mainly performs pieces in genres such as classic rock, alternative, punk, and other contemporary popular music. </p>

<p>The Key Elements also regularly travels to other east coast universities and just recently completed its first international tour in Ireland in January 2009.</p>

<p>Known as Cornell's Most Dangerous Sound Machine, as well as Cornell's first and only vocal rock group, the Key Elements is like no other group on campus. Unconventional? Check. Innovative? Check. Always pushing the envelope? That's a given.</p>
