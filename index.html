					<h1>ROCKING SINCE 1989</h1>
						<p>The Key Elements is a co-ed a cappella group at Cornell University. Founded in 1989, the group mainly performs pieces in<br/>
							genres such as classic rock, alternative, punk, and other contemporary popular music.&nbsp; </p>
						<p>The Key Elements also regularly travels to other east coast universities and completed its first international tour in Ireland in January 2009.</p>
						<p>Known as Cornell's Most Dangerous Sound Machine, as well as Cornell's first and only vocal rock group, the Key Elements is like no other group on campus.&nbsp; Unconventional?&nbsp; Check.&nbsp; Innovative?  Check.&nbsp; Always pushing the envelope?&nbsp; That's a given.</p>

						<h3>ROCKTOBERFEST XVI: THE KEY ELEMENTS ASSEMBLE<div class="date">10.17.14</div></h3>
<p><b>DATE:</b> OCTOBER 31<br>
<b>TIME:</b> 7 PM<br>
<b>PLACE:</b> STATLER AUDITORIUM<br>
Featuring Phenomenon Step Team</p>

<p>Last Thursday, The Key Elements collectively fell into a large vat of toxic, radioactive waste, giving them superhuman abilities (as if they weren't super enough).</p>

<p>Join them as they struggle to put together a full length concert while dealing with super strength, love of cats, and too much patriotism.</P.

<p>"But I want to see them right now! The Key Elements are so great! Why isn't their concert tonight?" 
Because they're the a cappella group Cornell deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So we'll wait until Halloween. Because we can take it. Because they're not our heroes. They are silent guardians. Watchful protectors. Until October 31st at 7:00pm in Statler Auditorium. When they will sing.</p>

<p><b>TICKETS:</b> $7 in advance, $10 at the door</p>

<p>To purchase tickets, get in touch with any Element, contact our business manager, <a href="mailto:ljl78@cornell.edu">Louis Levine</a>, or <i><b>pay online</i></b> via Paypal!</p>
