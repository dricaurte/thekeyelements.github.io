					<h1>ROCKING SINCE 1989</h1>
						<p>The Key Elements is a co-ed a cappella group at Cornell University. Founded in 1989, the group mainly performs pieces in<br>
							genres such as classic rock, alternative, punk, and other contemporary popular music.&nbsp; </p>
						<p>The Key Elements also regularly travels to other east coast universities and just recently completed its first international tour in Ireland in January 2009.</p>
						<p>Known as Cornell's Most Dangerous Sound Machine, as well as Cornell's first and only vocal rock group, the Key Elements is like no other group on campus.&nbsp; Unconventional?&nbsp; Check.&nbsp; Innovative?  Check.&nbsp; Always pushing the envelope?&nbsp; That's a given.</p>

					<h3>Happy Holidays from the Key Elements!<div class="date">12.21.09</div></h3>
					
					<p>
					Christmas is almost here, and along with that, the welcoming of the new year is fast approaching. To bring in the holiday season, we would like to recap all that the Key Elements have managed to do in the past year.
					</p>
					<p>
					To start off, we began the year with a 10-day winter tour of Ireland and Northern Ireland, during which we performed at several venues including The Waterford Crystal Factory and The Avalon House. In Spring of 2009, the 8 recruits from Fall of 2008 experienced their first Brave the Elements concert. This fall, for Rocktoberfest, we worked hard to arrange and perform 7 new songs, while still bringing back a few of the classics such as "More Than a Feeling," "All These Things That I've Done," and "Let's Get It On." Finally, we ended the fall semester by successfully auditioning for the International Championship of Callegiate A Cappella (ICCA).
					</p>
					<p>
					Even with such a great year, we are extremely excited for the new year to roll in as there are even greater things in store for us in 2010. In February, we will be competing at Nazareth College in Rochester in the quarter finals of the ICCA on February 26. Additionally, we will be recording a CD in the spring of 2010, which will include a combination of old favorites and new selections. This is looking to be a large and ambitious project, and we have already started the planning process. This is a very exciting time for us as it will be the first Key Elements CD to be released since 2006. Last, but not least, we will have our spring concert, Brave the Elements on April 24, which will showcase all that we have worked for in the past semesters.
					</p>
					<p>
					To reach all of our goals in the upcoming year, we are asking for help from our fans, parents, and alumni. Show your support today by giving a gift to The Key Elements! By doing so, you will help to fund the production of our new CD and will allows us to travel to the ICCA in February.
