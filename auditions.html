Please come prepared with a short contemporary solo (verse and chorus) that shows off your voice, and we'll help you through the rest. Audition week is one of our favorite times of the year and we can't wait to see what you have prepared for us!

					<h1>AUDITIONS FAQ</h1>
					<h2>When are auditions?</h2>
					<p>Auditions will be held at the beginning of each semester.</p>
					<h2>Who can audition?</h2>
					<p>
						Anyone!  In the past, we have accepted both seasoned musical veterans and shower-only singers.					</p>
					<h2>What do I have to bring with me to auditions?</h2>
					<p>
						Prepare a ~1 minute solo -- it should be contemporary music, something that shows off your voice.					</p>
                     <h2>What happens next?</h2>
					 <p>If we just couldn't get enough of your amazing talent at first-round auditions, then we'll contact you and let you know about callbacks. If you don't get called back, feel free to audition next time around. Some semesters we have a greater need for people than others.</p>
					 <h2>What are callbacks?</h2>
					 <p>Callbacks are like a rehearsal, where we get to know you as a person and as a singer. We'll teach you some music and evaluate how you might fit into the group. There's nothing really that can prepare you for callbacks, just come in good vocal health and ready to sing. (Save the partying for later).</p>
                     <h2>What if I get called back to multiple groups?</h2>
<p>We work together to make sure you get enough time with every group you get called back to.  In the end, it will be <em>your choice</em> when deciding which group to join.</p>
<h2>I'm nervous and I have lots of other questions that I need answered.</h2>
<p>Relax. People make mistakes and mess up during rehearsal all the time. We want to know how you sing, not if you can go forever without hitting a wrong note. If you have any questions, feel free to ask our Musical Director, <a href="mailto:mmf99@cornell.edu" style="color: #000000">Michelle Florentine</a>, or our President, <a href="mailto:mailto:ljl78@cornell.edu" style="color: #000000">Lou Levine</a>, anything.</p>
